At the conference, our Premier of Sarawak, The Right Honourable Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri (Dr) Abang Haji Abdul Rahman Zohari bin Tun Datuk Abang Haji Openg said Sarawak was committed to its target of net-zero emissions by 2050, largely by increasing its renewable energy capacity and electrifying the transport sector, which opens up opportunities for a green economy.
Opportunities can include investments in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, eco-tourism, green building, and other areas that promote environmental sustainability and reduce carbon emissions.
The green economy also presents numerous opportunities for businesses and individuals to develop new technologies, create new jobs, and drive economic growth while simultaneously reducing negative environmental impacts.
Some of the benefits of promoting a green economy include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved resource efficiency, increased resilience to climate change, improved health and well-being, and the creation of new jobs and economic opportunities.

At the conference, our Premier of Sarawak, The Right Honourable Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri (Dr) Abang Haji Abdul Rahman Zohari bin Tun Datuk Abang Haji Openg said Sarawak was committed to its target of net-zero emissions by 2050, largely by increasing its renewable energy capacity and electrifying the transport sector, which opens up opportunities for a green economy.
Opportunities can include investments in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, eco-tourism, green building, and other areas that promote environmental sustainability and reduce carbon emissions.
The green economy also presents numerous opportunities for businesses and individuals to develop new technologies, create new jobs, and drive economic growth while simultaneously reducing negative environmental impacts.
Some of the benefits of promoting a green economy include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved resource efficiency, increased resilience to climate change, improved health and well-being, and the creation of new jobs and economic opportunities.
